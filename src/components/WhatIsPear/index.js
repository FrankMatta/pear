      <p>
        Pear is a project that plays a much needed role in DeFi. The concept is
        simple, but elegant. Pear provides a platform for users to make direct
        P2P/OTC transfers of any cryptocurrency or fiat. By pairing up one user
        with another, Pear circumvents the need for liquidity, taxes, and avoids
        projects charts being negatively impacted by sales.
